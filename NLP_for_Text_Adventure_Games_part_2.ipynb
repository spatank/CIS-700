        "In this notebook, we will introduce you to word embeddings.  Word embeddings are a way of representing the meaning of words using vectors.  This style of meaning representation is different than what we saw with WordNet.  Rather than manually organizing words into a hierarchy and breaking words into their distinct senses like WordNet does, word vectors are computed automatically based on their coocurrence with other words in very large collections of texts (which are called _corpora_ in NLP).  Word vector representations do not give us hypernym, hyponym or antonym relationships by default, but they do give us an extremely straightforward way of computing the similarity of two words.  Similarity is computed by comparing the vectors and computing the cosine angle between them.  Vectors with a very small angle between them tend to correspond to words with very similar meanings.\n",
        "\n",
        "Starting around 2013, several algorithms were developed to efficiently create word vectors.  The most famous of which is the Word2Vec algorithm developed by researchers at Google. \n",
        "If you'd like to learn more about how word vectors work, I recommend that you read the [Vector Semantics and Embeddings](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/6.pdf) chapter in the [Speech and Language Processing textbook](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) by Jurafsky and Martin who are currently updating the textbook, and are relasing their draft chapters for free online while they are updating the book."
