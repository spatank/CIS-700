## Improved Parser Support 

* support for the Action Castle parser is improved using WordNet for the following commands
```
commands = [
	'wear crown',
	'smell rose',
	'eat fish',
	'light lamp',
	'give fish to troll',
	'propose to the princess',
	'go north',
]
```
* annotations of word senses for these commands results in expanded support 12524 commands instead of the 7 in the above list
* the improved parser is built on top of the simple string-matching parser
